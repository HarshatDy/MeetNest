To verify "The President" of a particular society in India, you can follow a few approaches depending on the context of the society, whether it's a registered society, cooperative, or other type of community-based organization. Here’s a breakdown of possible methods for verification:
1. Check the Society's Registration Documents
In India, societies are usually registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, or under state-specific acts (e.g., Maharashtra Societies Registration Act). The president's name should be mentioned in the society’s registration certificate, bye-laws, and minutes of the meetings.
Step 1: Get the society’s registration number (should be publicly available on documents or from the society's office).


Step 2: Visit the Registrar of Societies or the relevant State Government Website where the society is registered. Many states have online portals where you can search for registered societies by name or registration number.


For example:
Maharashtra has an online portal: Maharashtra Registrar of Societies


Delhi’s portal: Delhi Societies Registration


You can also find the details in physical records at the office of the Registrar in the state where the society is located.
2. Verify the Society's Committee from the AGM Records
The president of the society should be elected through an Annual General Meeting (AGM). The meeting minutes, resolutions, or annual reports usually include the names of elected office bearers. These documents should be available in the society’s office.
Step 1: Request or review the Annual General Meeting (AGM) records.


Step 2: Cross-reference with the current committee members.


3. Cross-Check with the Local Authorities
In case the society is a part of a local government body or has some public-private partnership or engagement, the authorities in charge of managing or overseeing the society can verify the president's identity.
Step 1: Contact the local municipal corporation, panchayat, or district office if the society is tied to local governance.


Step 2: They might have details on the elected representatives, including the president.


4. Online Verification Tools (Where Available)
Some states have online verification tools for society office bearers. For instance:
Cooperative Societies: In some states, cooperative societies are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and often have an online portal for verification.


Other Societies: If the society is a registered non-profit or similar, they may have a database where you can look up committee members.


5. Use Social Media or Public Records
In some cases, presidents of societies or organizations make their roles public through social media, websites, or press releases. This could serve as an informal way to verify the current president of the society.
6. Society's Own Website or Communication
If the society is active, they may maintain a website, newsletter, or social media page that publicly lists the current president. Checking their online presence can provide confirmation.

Steps for Building the Verification Process in Your App:
Require Documentation: In your app, you can request users to upload official documents (e.g., AGM minutes, society registration certificate) to confirm their role as president.


Integration with Government Database: If feasible, you could integrate with government portals or public databases to automatically verify the status of society office bearers in real-time.


Manual Verification Process: You can have an option for manual verification where the users can submit proof, and your team can verify the documents and confirm the role of the president with the relevant authorities or society records.


Use of OTPs or Email Verification: If the society has a formal communication channel, you could potentially integrate a verification method where the president’s official email or phone number (from society records) is used to send an OTP for verification.
